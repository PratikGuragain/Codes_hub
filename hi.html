        <p>Every prime number >(greater than)2 %(modulo)3 can be written in the form 4<sup>n+1</sup> or 4<sup>n+3</sup> </p><br>
        <h1>Proof</h1><br>
        <p>Any number p when / (divided by) 4 leaves remainder 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, the number has the form 4<sup>n</sup>, 4<sup>n + 1</sup>, or 4<sup>n+ 2</sup>. Since 4<sup>n</sup> and 4<sup>n + 2</sup> are even, they can not be a form of a prime number which is an odd number (except 2). Therefore, the only possible forms for prime numbers > 2 that are not divisible by 3 are 4<sup>n+1</sup> and 4<sup>n+3</sup>. This proves the theorem. â—»</p><br>
